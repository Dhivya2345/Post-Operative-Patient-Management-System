# Post-Operative-Patient-Management-System

# Project Overview

The Post-Operative Patient Management System is a web-based healthcare application designed to simplify the management of post-operative patients in hospitals. It focuses on improving efficiency in departments such as Cardiology and Oncology, where continuous monitoring and documentation are critical.

# Problem Description

In hospitals, doctors and nurses handle multiple post-operative patients every day. Reviewing patient reports, monitoring recovery progress, and updating records manually is time-consuming and inefficient. Interns also face difficulty in understanding procedures and patient conditions due to limited guidance.

# Solution

To address these challenges, this project provides a secure web application that allows:
Doctors and nurses to add and manage patient details
Viewing of scanned medical reports in a centralized system
Easy monitoring of patient recovery status
An AI assistant to support interns in learning about medical procedures and patient conditions

# Key Features
Centralized access to patient reports and recovery details
Role-based access for doctors, nurses, and interns
AI-assisted learning support for interns

# Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
Backend: Node.js
Database: SQL
